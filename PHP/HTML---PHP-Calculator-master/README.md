# HTML---PHP-Calculator
This is a calculator created to practice handling HTML forms in PHP.

## Starting üöÄ

_I'm going to build a calculator to do addition and division of two integer numbers.

Each calculator will appear as a separate form for the user on the initial page, which will be contained in index.php_

## Extra! ‚öôÔ∏è

* Implement more complicated math operations, like the Pythagorean theorem. The calculator could return the length of a hypotenuse given the two other sides.
* Add more CSS styling to the application.
* Combine the two forms into a single form.
