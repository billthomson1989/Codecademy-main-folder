# PHP-Number-Guessing
This is a number guessing game to practice conditionals in PHP.

## Starting! ðŸš€

In this project, Iâ€™ll create a number guessing game. The program will generate a random number between 1 and 10. The program runs the game 10 times and tell the user some information about their guessing abilities.
