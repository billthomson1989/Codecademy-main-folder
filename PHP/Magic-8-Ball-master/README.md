# Magic-8-Ball
In this project I'll create a  Magic 8-Ball program to practice conditionals in PHP.

## Starting! 🚀

The Magic 8-Ball is a popular toy used for fortune-telling or seeking advice.

In this project, I’ll be creating a function that can answer any “yes” or “no” question.

Magic 8-Ball, should I do this project?

The answers inside a standard Magic 8-Ball are:

* It is certain.
* It is decidedly so.
* Without a doubt.
* Yes - definitely.
* You may rely on it.
* As I see it, yes.
* Most likely.
* Outlook good.
* Yes.
* Signs point to yes.
* Reply hazy, try again.
* Ask again later.
* Better not tell you now.
* Cannot predict now.
* Concentrate and ask again.
* Don't count on it.
* My reply is no.
* My sources say no.
* Outlook not so good.
* Very doubtful.

**The magic8Ball() will take in any “yes” or “no” question (as a string) and give a psychic (random) answer.**
