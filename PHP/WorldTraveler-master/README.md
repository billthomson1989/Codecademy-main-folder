This is a simple PHP exercise to practice operations with numbers. 

## Let's start! ðŸš€

_Help a weary traveler convert their various international currencies into USD._

Hello there, friend! Weâ€™re exhausted having just returned to New York City from a whirlwind of world travel. Weâ€™re bringing all our international currency to the bank to be exchanged for USD. Our travels have made us wise and weary, and we want to ensure weâ€™re being treated fairly. Can you help?

Write a program to calculate exactly how much cash in USD we should end up with after it has all been exchanged.

* We had a blissful time at Lake Yeak Laom in Ratanakiri, Cambodia and ended up with **2103942 riel** left in our pocket.
* We saw the best sunset of our lives in Hpa-an, Myanmar and left the country with **19092 kyat**.
* We got our fill of fjords in Bergen, Norway and discovered **109 krones** that went unspent.
* We soaked up the sun and history in Saranda, Albania and found **9094 lek** scattered throughout our luggage when we arrived home to NYC.

**The currency exchange business takes a flat $1 fee per conversion.**
