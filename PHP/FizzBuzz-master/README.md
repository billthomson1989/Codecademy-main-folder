# FizzBuzz
Practice some loops with this simple exercise!

### What is FizzBuzz? üìã

FizzBuzz is one of the most commonly used interview questions for applicants to programming positions.

### Let's do it! ‚å®Ô∏è

Write code that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive), except for these cases:
- If a number is a multiple of 3, write "Fizz".
- If a number is a multiple of 5, write "Buzz".
- If a number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, write "FizzBuzz".

## Extra üìå

* The interviewer has asked that now you avoid printing anything when a number is divisible by 3 ("Fizz").
* As a final step, the interviewer has asked that now you stop printing values after the first "FizzBuzz".
