    <ul>
      <li>The First Spinjitzu Master was the creator of Spinjitzu and all of Ninjago.</li>
      <li> He was also the father of Garmadon and Wu, Misako's father-in-law, and Lloyd's paternal grandfather.</li>
      <li> He was born from the worlds of both the Oni and the Dragons, the warring sides of a seemingly never-ending conflict within the first realm.</li>
      <li> Unwilling to choose a side, he abandoned his original world to create the realm of Ninjago using the Golden Weapons.</li>
      <li>
        After defeating a dark entity of pure evil, The Overlord, and splitting the land into two halves, he empowered humans with Elemental Powers to become his guardians.</li>
      <li> Eventually, he fathered two sons, Wu and Garmadon, and entrusted them with defending the Golden Weapons.</li>
      <li> After the First Spinjitzu Master's demise, he was buried in a tomb deep in the Endless Sea, where the Realm Crystal was also stored away.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Movie:Harry Potter</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>The wizarding world, also referred to as the magical community, is the society in which wizards and witches live and interact separate from the Muggle (non-wizarding) society.</li>
      <li> The two communities are kept separate through the use of charms, spells, and secrecy.</li>
      <li> Wizards are forbidden to reveal anything about magic to Muggle society due to the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy.</li>
      <li> Each country has a form of wizarding government to oversee magical affairs in their territory, such as a Ministry of Magic or a Council of Magic.</li>
      <li> The International Confederation of Wizards serves as a wizarding intergovernmental organisation.</li>
      <li>
        Magic is honed through study, training and formal schooling, but cannot be simply learnt by Muggles.</li>
      <li> Non-magic skills, such as picking a lock with a hairpin rather than an Unlocking Charm, are uncommon to the point of novel rarity.</li>
      <li> Magic is used for mostly everything, including cooking, cleaning, travelling, communicating, child rearing and medical treatment.</li>
      <li> Although on the surface, magic appears morally neutral, the benevolence or malevolence of a spell's nature is tied to the intention behind it.
        <li>
          <li> For instance, the Cruciatus Curse cannot effectively torture a victim with pain unless the caster desires to do true harm to the victim.</li>
          <li> The technology of the wizarding world appears medieval in character (such as Hogwarts not having any lifts, but instead having only stairs), as the use of magic precludes the need for advanced technology (as well as the fact that magic interferes
            with electrical equipment).</li>
