# Going-to-Bed
This project provides practice for:  Creating objects from classes -Writing and using methods - Using static methods

### Task 🔧

In this project we will be creating some pajamas for barnyard animals. The farmer has a special way that she likes names formatted. To ensure this, we are going to build our own string function similar to PHP’s built in strtolower or strtoupper.

* The farmer likes names to be entirely lowercase, except for the second letter, which should always be uppercase. While “Q” might not be a popular name, our method should handle single characters gracefully.
* The pajamas have 3 properties: owner, fit and color.
* Use a constructor.
* Add a public describe method which returns a string using the 3 properties to tell us about the object.
* For testing. Create an instance of the Pajamas class for “CHICKEN”.
* Some animals need their pajamas to have buttons so that they can put them on.
* The status of the buttons should be (“buttoned” or “unbuttoned”).
* For testing create an instance of buttoned pajamas for "moose".


### Extra! 📋

For additional practice:

* A class of pajamas that has a hat
* Performing validation on setFit to only allow “tight”, “fine”, and “loose”
* Setter and getter methods for the owner and color properties
